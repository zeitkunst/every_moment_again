# Every moment again

THE SPECTRUM REACHES YOU<br/>
<br/>
IN THE GLARE IS ALBEREO<br/>
<br/>
YOU FEEL NOW<br/>
WHAT IS ABOUT 430 YEARS OLD<br/>
<br/>
THE TIME OF THIS LIGHT<br/>
IS OUR PAST<br/>
<br/>
what remains of this past<br/>
what remains of this past<br/>
<br/>
AVOID CALLING ALBEREO<br/>
<br/>
you must wait<br/>
you must wait<br/>
you won't wait<br/>
<br/>
for a response<br/>
<br/>
WHAT OF NOW<br/>
WILL BE HERE THEN<br/>
<br/>
IN THIS PLACE<br/>
<br/>
IN THE PRESENT OF ALBEREO<br/>

#  Every moment again (On Your Wrist is the Universe)

The above poem come from a suite entitled *Every moment again: (On Your Wrist is the Universe)*. These poems are for the [Pebble smartwatch platform](https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/59724027461a8d9e490001f5) and are automatically generated based on what stars are above the wearer at that time and place. The watch, when paired with one's phone, is able to know the wearer's location and time of day and thus predict what stars are up above, day or night (since the stars are of course there during the day, they are simply too faint to see in the sun's glare). These poems are constructed to get the wearer to think about temporality beyond that of the hour minute second, and further into the cosmic domains of light between here and nearby stars.

All code for the generation of the poem is available here in Github.
